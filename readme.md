This directory contains examples for OPC client and subscriber development in VBScript.The 
examples cover OPC Data Access (OPC DA), OPC Alarms&Events (OPC A&E), OPC XML, and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) 
specifications, including OPC UA PubSub. They are supported on Microsoft Windows.

The examples can be run
* on the Web server (in the ASP page), or
* in the Web browser (Internet Explorer), or
* standalone (under Windows Script Host).

The examples work with our sample servers and publishers. Most of them reside on the Web; OPC "Classic" servers for Windows
are installed using the [Connectivity Software Setup program](https://www.opclabs.com/download).
